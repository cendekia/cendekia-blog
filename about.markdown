## About Cendekia

Cendekia is derived from the Indonesian word for "scholar" or "intellectual" - someone dedicated to knowledge and learning. This blog serves as my digital journal for documenting the creation of various software projects from conception to completion.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this site are:

- **Document the Development Process**: Share the real journey of building software, including challenges and solutions
- **Track Project Progress**: Visualize development timelines and milestones
- **Share Technical Insights**: Explain interesting technical problems and their solutions
- **Build in Public**: Embrace transparency by sharing both successes and failures

## About Me

I'm a software developer passionate about building useful applications and sharing knowledge with others. This blog is both a personal notebook and a way to contribute to the developer community by documenting real-world project development.

## Tech Stack

This site is built with:

- **Jekyll**: Static site generator
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting platform
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation for deployment

The source code for this site is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/cendekiapp/cendekiapp.com), so you can see exactly how it's built.
