# AutoTestify

AutoTestify is a dynamic QA checklist application designed to streamline the testing process through AI assistance, Slack integration, and real-time test case management. The platform will enable QA teams to collaborate effectively, automate test case generation, and provide real-time visibility into testing progress.

## Background

The idea for AutoTestify emerged from the challenges faced by QA teams in our organization:

1. Manual test case creation is time-consuming and often leads to inconsistency
2. Communication between QA, developers, and project managers is fragmented
3. There is limited visibility into testing progress for stakeholders
4. Test case documentation is scattered across different tools and platforms

We've decided to build a solution that will address these challenges by leveraging modern technologies and integrating with the tools our teams already use. Our goal is to create a platform that makes QA testing more efficient, collaborative, and insightful.

## Current Progress

Development officially began on April 26, 2025. So far, we have completed the following milestones:

- Initializing the Next.js frontend with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Setting up the NestJS backend with TypeScript configuration
- Creating the Docker environment for PostgreSQL
- Configuring environment variables and port settings
- Establishing the project structure for both repositories
- Creating comprehensive TypeORM entity models for all system components
- Setting up TypeORM integration with NestJS and PostgreSQL
- Configuring database migration infrastructure

Check out our latest [Week 2 update blog post](/blogs/2025/04/28/autotestify-week2-entity-models/) for detailed information about our progress.

## Planned Timeline

Below is our development timeline showing key phases and milestones:

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Configuration (Weeks 1-2: Apr 26 - May 10)

- âœ… Initialize Next.js frontend project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- âœ… Set up NestJS backend project with TypeScript
- âœ… Configure Docker environment for PostgreSQL database
- âœ… Create initial database schema and entity models
- ðŸ”„ Implement JWT authentication with Slack OAuth support

### Phase 2: Database Schema and Backend Core (Weeks 3-4: May 11 - May 24)

- ðŸ”„ Implement user management module with CRUD operations
- Create project and sprint management functionality
- Develop test case module for managing test cases
- Set up logging module for user actions and system events

### Phase 3: Integration Services (Weeks 5-6: May 25 - Jun 7)

- Implement Slack integration for slash commands and webhooks
- Develop Trello integration for card syncing
- Create AI service for test case generation from documents
- Build document parser for different formats (PDF, Markdown, Notion)

### Phase 4: Real-time Communication (Weeks 7-8: Jun 8 - Jun 21)

- Set up WebSocket server for real-time updates
- Implement service for broadcasting test case updates
- Create event system for real-time notifications

### Phase 5: Frontend Development (Weeks 9-11: Jun 22 - Jul 12)

- Implement authentication flows and user management
- Create dashboard with overview statistics
- Develop project and sprint management interface
- Build test case management pages
- Implement document upload for AI processing

### Phase 6: Final Features and Deployment (Weeks 12-13: Jul 13 - Jul 26)

- Implement filtering and search functionality
- Create comprehensive testing suite
- Configure CI/CD pipeline
- Set up production deployment
- Create system documentation

## Anticipated Technical Challenges

We anticipate several technical challenges in this project:

1. **Integration Architecture**: Designing a flexible architecture that can integrate with multiple third-party services (Slack, Trello, AI) while maintaining loose coupling.

2. **Real-time Updates**: Implementing real-time test case status updates that synchronize across multiple clients will require careful consideration of websocket architecture and event handling.

3. **Document Parsing**: Creating a service that can parse different document formats (PDF, Markdown, Notion) for AI processing will require implementing multiple parsing strategies and handling edge cases.

4. **AI Integration**: Developing prompts and interfaces for AI test case generation that produce consistent, high-quality test cases will require experimentation with different prompt templates and AI models.

## Next Steps

Our immediate next steps for Week 3 are:

- Implement user authentication module with JWT support
- Begin Slack OAuth integration setup
- Start development of the user management module with CRUD operations

We'll continue to provide weekly updates on our progress through blog posts.
