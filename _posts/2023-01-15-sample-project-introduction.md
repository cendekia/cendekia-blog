## Project Background

As a developer, I've always been interested in building full-stack applications that provide real value to users. The Sample Project aims to be a demonstration of modern web development practices, from planning to deployment.

This project was born out of a need to create a template for future projects, showcasing how I approach development, document my process, and overcome challenges along the way.

## Why This Project Matters

In today's fast-paced development world, it's not just about writing code that works; it's about creating maintainable, scalable solutions that can evolve over time. This project will serve as a reference for best practices in:

- **Frontend Development**: Building a responsive UI with React and modern CSS techniques
- **Backend Architecture**: Creating a well-structured Node.js API with proper separation of concerns
- **Database Design**: Implementing MongoDB collections with relationships and efficient queries
- **Authentication**: Securing the application with JWT-based authentication
- **Testing**: Ensuring code quality with comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Technology Stack

For this project, I've chosen a stack that balances modern capabilities with stability:

### Frontend
- React 18 for the user interface
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation

### Backend
- Node.js with Express for the API
- MongoDB for data storage
- JWT for authentication
- Jest for testing

## Development Approach

The development will follow these principles:

1. **User-First Design**: All features will be designed with the end user in mind
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Writing tests before implementation to ensure quality
3. **Iterative Development**: Building features incrementally and refining them
4. **Documentation**: Maintaining clear documentation throughout the process

Follow along as I document each step of the journey, sharing insights, challenges, and solutions along the way!
