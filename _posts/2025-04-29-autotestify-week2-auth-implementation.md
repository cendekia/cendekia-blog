## Authentication System Implementation Progress

Week 2 of AutoTestify development focused on implementing a robust authentication system that supports both traditional JWT authentication and Slack OAuth integration. This foundation will ensure secure access to our QA checklist application while providing seamless integration with Slack workspaces.

### Authentication Module Setup

The authentication module has been successfully implemented with the following components:

1. **Core Authentication Service**
   - User validation methods
   - Login functionality with JWT token generation
   - User registration with proper validation
   - Token validation and refresh mechanisms
   - Slack user validation and mapping

2. **Authentication Controller**
   - Login endpoint with credentials validation
   - Registration endpoint with data validation
   - Profile retrieval endpoint for authenticated users
   - Slack OAuth callback handler

3. **Passport Strategy Implementation**
   - JWT strategy for token-based authentication
   - Slack strategy for OAuth authentication
   - Custom guards for protecting routes

### Implementation Details

#### JWT Authentication

The JWT authentication system has been implemented with security best practices:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class AuthService {
  constructor(
    private readonly jwtService: JwtService,
    private readonly usersService: UsersService,
  ) {}

  async validateUser(email: string, password: string): Promise<any> {
    const user = await this.usersService.findByEmail(email);
    if (user && await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password)) {
      const { password, ...result } = user;
      return result;
    }
    return null;
  }

  async login(user: any) {
    const payload = { email: user.email, sub: user.id };
    return {
      access_token: this.jwtService.sign(payload),
    };
  }
}
```

#### Slack OAuth Integration

The Slack OAuth flow has been implemented to handle workspace authentication:

```typescript
@Controller('auth')
export class AuthController {
  @Get('slack/callback')
  async slackCallback(@Query('code') code: string) {
    const tokenData = await this.authService.exchangeSlackCode(code);
    const userInfo = await this.authService.getSlackUserInfo(tokenData.access_token);
    
    // Map Slack user to system user
    const user = await this.authService.findOrCreateSlackUser(userInfo);
    
    return this.authService.login(user);
  }
}
```

### Environment Configuration

To use the authentication system, the following environment variables need to be configured:

```env
# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRATION=24h

# Slack OAuth Configuration
SLACK_CLIENT_ID=your_slack_client_id
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_slack_client_secret
SLACK_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3001/auth/slack/callback
```

### Route Protection

Routes can now be protected using the JWT authentication guard:

```typescript
@Controller('api')
export class SomeController {
  @UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)
  @Get('protected')
  getProtectedData() {
    return { message: 'This is protected data' };
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

With the authentication system in place, we'll focus on implementing the user management module next week. This will include:

1. Creating CRUD operations for user management
2. Implementing role-based access control
3. Developing user profile management features
4. Setting up email verification system

The project continues to progress according to schedule, and we're well-positioned to begin work on user management features in Week 3.
